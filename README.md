ORGANIZATION:   
  A) BUSINESS/CAPITAL oriented   
  B) NGO/non-profit oriented     
  C) Social media oriented  
  
sectors:  
  1)finance/economy/tax of individual vs authority vs organization  
  2)power&freedom of speech, self-defense of authority vs individual vs organization  
  3)education  
  4)military power/national security and restrictions against it  
  5)execution of government's orders by government officers including army  
  6)fundamental belief of people  
  7)laws-making  
  8)NGO and social media  
  9)enforcement of laws and regulations  
  10)economic growth and ensure sustainability    
  
  11) framework of authority
      
  A) LISTS OF NECESSARY BRANCH OF AUTHORITY ADMINISTRATION  
  i) judiciary & law & policy enforcement & budget-auditing   
    .) strengthen the power of enforcement
    
  ii) making of law/policy/people's voice  
      .) ensure more transparency  
      .) ensure efficient survey of people's voice  
      .) let people uphold more power in local area
      
  iii) development including education, entertainment, arts, science/technology & public health & agriculture & construction & capital investment.  
      .) half-privatise government institutions, but empowers the authority to audit and veto the decisions of the private organization.  
      .) each field is studied by each different commitee. The minister duty is to set the priority and reject the proposals by the comittees.  
      .) education: debate class should be held each day for 1 hour
      .) a school for students where it teaches lessons in tamil, mandarin and malay in different period.
      .) 
      
  
  iv) royals & armed officers (comittee)  
      .) allow them to have a representative 

  v) intelligence/information/national security/media/speech freedom
      .) One official media in the name of government
      .) private media within standards set and audited by citizens+NGO should also be funded, to avoid malicious foreign interference.
      .) information should be classified and labeled clearly as government/organization_verified & non-verified information.
      .) ensure freedom of speech, but authority should label the information and empowered to leave government comments.  
      .) people should be trained for national defense.  
    
  vi) resouce/finance/tax/election funding management  
      .) reduce tax rate, 
      reasons:  
      1) tax collected are likely being mishandled.  
      2) rich people able to evade tax easily, only less wealthy people have to pay all their tax  
      
      .) let citizen involve directly in tender & public construction like roads and even other fundings.   
      .)
